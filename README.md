###Sample Python code for Interview

The following code reflects roughly 3-4 hours of my time.

I had problems running the notebook, so I included the script I was developing.

I attempted to scrape IMDb data. Specifically I tried scraping the actor rating data and then with a simple key-match with the actor's name, put it back into the master data frame. This is doable, but would take another afternoon.

This was a fun project.

Thanks for your time,

Gene Kafka
